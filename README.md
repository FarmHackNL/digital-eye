Van den Borne: een camera systeem om foto's van gewassen te maken op willekeurige locaties

**The farmer's problem**
- has a lot of data (maps, satellite/drone images, sensors) but lacks *visual* information about his/her crops
- collecting visual information (photographs) is a manual - and therefore error prone - process

**Our solution**: automate the picture taking process by
- attaching a smart camera to a farm vehicle
- building an app/platfrom that 1) allows the farmer to pinpoint locations that he/she wants photographed and 2) makes the camera take pictures when the machine passes these locations
- collecting all photographs at a central location combined with additional information such as date, plot ID, time, crop, weathers, etc.
